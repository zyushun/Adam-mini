# Adam-mini

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of Adam-mini optimizer, a mini-version of Adam that achieves on-par or better performance than AdamW with **50%** less memory footprint.

Adam-mini reduces memory by cutting down the learning rate (lr) resources in Adam (i.e., $1/\sqrt{v}$): we argue that **>99.9%** of these lr in $v$ could be harmlessly removed if we:

(1) carefully partition the parameters into blocks following our proposed principle related to **Hessian structure**.  
(2) assign a single **but good** lr to each parameter block.

We find a simple and effective way to reach these requirements. The resulting algorithm is shown below in **Algorithm 1**. Check out more detailed descriptions in our paper: [Adam-mini: Use Fewer Learning Rates To Gain More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16793).

## How to use

Install torch (>=2.1.0) and run the following commands.

```
pip install adam-mini
```

or if you prefer to import from source

```
git clone https://github.com/zyushun/Adam-mini
cd Adam-mini
pip install -e .
```

Then use Adam-mini optimizer as follows.

```
from adam_mini import Adam_mini

optimizer = Adam_mini(
            named_parameters = model.named_parameters(),
            lr = lr,
            betas = (beta1,beta2),
            eps = eps,
            weight_decay = weight_decay,
            dim = model_config.dim,
            n_heads = model_config.n_heads,
            n_kv_heads = model_config.n_kv_heads, #default to be none
            )

```

**Hyperparameter choices:** Regarding learning rate (lr), weight_decay, beta1, beta2, eps, we recommend using the same values as those used for AdamW.

If you are training Transformers, please also pass the following info to Adam-mini:

- dim: dimension for hidden feature. Could be unspecified if you are training non-transformer models.

- n_heads: number of attention heads. Could be unspecified if you are training non-transformer models.

- n_kv_heads: number of head for Key and Value. Or equivalently, number of query groups in Group query Attention. Also known as "n_query_groups". If is None, it will be the same value as n_head. Could be unspecified if you are training non-transformer models.

**Remark:** If your total training step is small (<10k or 20k), we recommend adding the following line. This will apply a single lr for Value and we find it can speed up the initial convergence of Adam-mini. See [Appendix C.3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16793) in the paper for more discussion.

```
optimizer.wv_names = {} 
```

## Examples

We here provide sample code on pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. You need 2xA800-80GB or 2xA100-80GB GPUs to run the experiments below.

### Example 1: GPT2 series Pre-training

We pre-train GPT2 series (125M, 330M, 1.5B) using [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) codebase under DDP framework. Install dependencies from pip:

```
conda env create -f gpt2/environment.yml
conda activate gpt2
cd examples/gpt2
```

Run the code for GPT2 pre-training:

```
bash run_gpt2.sh
```

You will get the following curves.

### Example 2: Llama series Pre-training

We here provide a sample code for pre-training Llama series (from 39M to 13B) using [Torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan) code base under FSDP framework. We recommend using Torchtitan codebase as it will be much faster than NanoGPT codebase for processing the same amount of tokens. 

Install dependence from pip (or please see the instructions from [Torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan)):

```
cd examples/llama
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install --pre torch==2.5.0.dev20240617  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121 #or cu118
pip3 install --pre torchdata --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly
```

Download a tokenizer.model. Follow the instructions on the official [meta-llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) repository to ensure you have access to the Llama model weights. Once you have confirmed access, you can run the following command to download the Llama 3 / Llama 2 tokenizer to your local machine.

```
# Get your HF token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

# llama3 tokenizer.model
python torchtitan/datasets/download_tokenizer.py --repo_id meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --tokenizer_path "original" --hf_token=...

# llama2 tokenizer.model
python torchtitan/datasets/download_tokenizer.py --repo_id meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf --hf_token=...
```

Change your data path in the configuration file (for instance,  ./train_configs/llama3_8b_mini.toml).  To debug, you can download the small dataset "c4_mini" via [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B16KpuhUyz4p7mwc9xmRHuyCY37dAw-2?usp=sharing) and put it under the path "./torchtitan/datasets/c4_mini/".

```
dataset = "c4" #for debug can use "c4_mini"
dataset_path = "your_path/c4" #for debug can use "./torchtitan/datasets/c4_mini/"
```

Then we can kick off the training. For instance, you can train Llama models from 39M to 1B and  reproduce our scaling-law experiments. You can  train all models for  a complete pre-training run by Chinchilla's law. The total running time would be about 300 GPU hours (we tested on 4*A800-80GB GPUs).

```
bash run_llama_2_scaling_law.sh
```

You can get the following curves (after changing x-axis into FLOPs and taking log)

<img src="figures/scaling_law.png" style="zoom:100%;" />

After a complete pre-training run by Chinchilla's law, you will get the following the final validation perplexity.

<img src="figures/perplexity_table.png" style="zoom:100%;" />

In particular, the training curves of 1B model will look like the following.



<img src="figures/0928_adam_mini_1b.png" style="zoom:200%;" />



You can also pre-train Llama3-8B and Llama2-13B using the folloiwng code.

```
bash run_llama_3_8b.sh
bash run_llama_2_13b.sh

#after creating the optimize
optimizer.wv_names = {} # For experiments with relatively small total steps  (like the 8B and 13B experiments here, we only run for 10k steps), we apply a single lr for Value and find it performs a bit better
```

You will get the following curves.

<img src="figures/1001_llama3_8b_13b.png" style="zoom:200%;" />

### Example 2: Llama2-7B Supervised Fine-tuning and RLHF

We fine-tune Llama2-7B using [ReMax](https://github.com/liziniu/ReMax) codebase under [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples/tree/master/applications/DeepSpeed-Chat) framework. Install dependencies from pip:

```
conda env create -f RLHF/environment.yml
conda activate rlhf
cd examples/RLHF
```

Run the code for SFT with LoRA :

```
bash training_scripts/sft/run_sft_lora.sh
```

Run the code for full-parameter SFT :

```
bash training_scripts/sft/run_sft_full.sh
```

Run the code for reward model training in RLHF

```
bash training_scripts/reward/run_reward.sh
```

Run the code for reward optimization in RLHF using ReMax:

```
bash training_scripts/po/remax/run_remax.sh
```

You will get the following curves.

## Remarks

**How to use Adam-mini in Huggingface Trainer**. If you are using Huggingface Trainer, please overwrite "create_optimizer" as follows to change optimizer:

```
 def create_optimizer(self) -> "torch.optim.Optimizer":
        if self.optimizer is None:
            if (self.finetuning_args.use_adammini):
                self.optimizer = Adam_mini(
            named_parameters = model.named_parameters(),
            lr = lr,
            betas = (beta1,beta2),
            eps = eps,
            weight_decay = weight_decay,
            model_sharding = True,
            dim = model_config.dim,
            n_heads = model_config.n_heads,
            n_kv_heads = model_config.n_kv_heads,
            )
        return super().create_optimizer()
```

**About checkpoint saving under FSDP:** If you are using FSDP distributed framework, we apologize that we still have unexpected error for saving checkpoints. We are working on it and will update soon.

**About CPU offload:** Our current implementation of Adam-mini supports CPU offload in FSDP, while it does not support CPU offload in DeepSpeed. Please turn off offload when using DeepSpeed. We will resolve this issue soon.

## Changelog

[24/06/26] We are online!

[24/07/21] We now support the Adam-mini by pip install

[24/08/09] We now support the Adam-mini in [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory).

[24/09/04] We update Adam-mini to version 1.0.3 in PyPI (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/adam-mini/)). We deprecate the argument "model_sharding". We will assume that model parallelism is always used and "model_sharding" is always set True. We will remove this argument in the future version.

[24/09/18] We update Adam-mini to version 1.0.4 in PyPI (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/adam-mini/)). We add the argument "verbose" to allow manually mute the logs by Adam-mini. We support CPU-offload in FSDP.

[24/10/18] We update Adam-mini to version 1.1.0 in PyPI (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/adam-mini/)). This is a major update: we change the partition rules for attn_proj, MLPs, embedding, and the output layer. In particular, we design a new partition strategy for the embedding & output layer, and now Adam-mini no longer need to treat these two layers as special cases. As a result, Adam-mini now saves 50% memory over Adam for all models of any size (previously is 45% to 50% reduction for >1B models).  

[24/11/29] We update Adam-mini to version 1.1.1 in PyPI (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/adam-mini/)). We fixed the log issue in [Issue #30](https://github.com/zyushun/Adam-mini/issues/30).
